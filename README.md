The "**Drinks Demo App**" is a sample SPA web application that shows you awesome alcoholic drinks!

[Preview the app here](https://imalitavakoli.github.io/drinks-app/).

*Drinks Demo App* is just an other sample SPA web app that I have built by `Vue.js`, `jQuery`, and `Framework8` (my personal Front-end Framework). It connects to the [thecocktaildb.com](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API and loads the alcoholic drinks.




# Features

- **alcoholic drinks** at a glance!
- Clean UI & easy UX.
- Structure & scaffolding based on `Vue.js` best practices.
- **Routing** based on REST architecture.
- **State management** pattern used.
- All API calls from a single place.
- 404 page is built in.
- Loading and error states are considered, while connecting to API.
- Cleaning the API JSON response, when providing it to the HTML templates.
- Comments everywhere inside of the codes.
- Designed a pre-loader as an app-shell.
- **Light/dark mode switch**. User's preferred theme will be saved for next visits. By default, it first looks at the theme mode preference at the OS level.
- **Modular (scalable)** CSS & JS architecture components powered by Framework8 (my personal Front-end Framework).
- CSS components designed based on **BEM Methodology**.
- **CSS variables** for colors, sizes, spaces, fonts, etc.
